1st Selenium Automation Commit - Intro to automation with Chrome.Driver, Gecko.Driver, and Selenium Framework jars

Created Java Application via Sprint Tool Suit 4.
In this application we take a quick dive on how to write automation test scripts with Selenium Framework.
In the 'lib' folder, you will find all the needed jars to make this script possible.
We will be using the Chrome.Driver to run our test script Google Chrome browser,
and will be using the Gecko.Driver to run our test script on Mozilla Firefox broswer.

This automation test script gives you an option to listen to 2 songs, it will automate to YouTube,
search for the desired song, select it, skip the ads, and turn on full screen on desired video.
Also, it provides an option to automate YouTube to play a video that helps you understand Selenium Automation
to a deepr level. 
Enjoy!
